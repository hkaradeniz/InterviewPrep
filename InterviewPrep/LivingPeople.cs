        Living People: Given a list of people with their birth and death years, implement a method to
        compute the year with the most number of people alive. You may assume that all people were born
        between 1900 and 2000 (inclusive). If a person was alive during any portion of that year, they should
        be included in that year's count. For example, Person (birth= 1908, death= 1909) is included in the
        counts for both 1908 and 1909.
